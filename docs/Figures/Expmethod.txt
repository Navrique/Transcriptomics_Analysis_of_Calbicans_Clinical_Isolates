Methods:

Strains and media

C. albicans isolates pairs from clade one CEC3621, CEC3678, CEC3605 and CEC3617
were stored at -80 °C in glycerol supplemented medium. Strains were maintained in YPD
(1% Yeast extract, 2% Peptone, 2% Glucose) agar plates and grown in YPD broth for
overnight cultures the day before this experiment.

Seeding C. albicans for RNA-seq

The day before experiment, pre-overnights of C. albicans strains to be used are prepared in
5 ml of YPD broth by taking up two-three colonies from a YPD agar plate. These are
incubated at 30°C in a shaking incubator for 8 h approximately. Overnights of the strains are
set up to a final concentration of an ODooo of 0.1 (1 x 10$ cells/ml) in 10 ml of YPD in
Erlenmeyer flasks. Flasks are incubated at 30°C in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm.

The day of experiment, C. albicans cells were centrifuged (500 Hl) and washed three times
with PBS. The yeast cells were resuspended and diluted in F12 medium to obtain a
concentration of 1.5 x 108 cells/ml. In six 96 well plates (two for each time point), relevant
wells were filed with 100 pl of fresh F12 medium. A volume of 100 lil of the C. albicans cell
dilutions was distributed to each well of the 96 well plate to obtain a concentration of 1.5 x
107 cells/well.

Plates are incubated at 37°C and 5% CO; for the relevant times.
Times:

- Candida cultures are taken out @ 00:00 h.

- Candida cell dilutions are set up @ 00:00 h.

- _Seeding of 0 h, 3 h and 6 h time points are set up @ 00:00 h.
- Time point Oh is snap freezed immediately @ 00:00 h.

-_ Plate of3his freezed @ 00:00 h.

-__ Plate of6 his freezed @ 00:00 h.

After X h of infection, plates are spun down at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Keep the plate on
ice. Remove 150 {il of the supernatant, seal plate with parafilm, and snap freeze immediately
in liquid nitrogen. Plates are stored at -80°C until lysis and homogenization.

RNA extraction (7h approx. for 45 samples) — Quick RNA Fungal/Bacterial Miniprep
kit (Zymo)

Add 96 ml of 100% ethanol to the 24 ml RNA wash buffer concentrate provided by the kit.
Reconstitute the DNase | as indicated on the vial prior to use, and store at -20°C.

Take the plates out of -80°C [@ 00:00 h] and add 150 pl of RNA Lysis Buffer to each well. Do
not let the plate reach room temperature. Using a tip, scrape the cells off the wells and
transfer to an Eppendorf tube containing 600 li of Lysis Buffer. Mix contents with a tip before
transferring the whole 800 ll to the ZR BashingBead Lysis tubes (0.5 mm).

Samples were homogenized six times for 2 minutes at 30 Hz using the TissueLyser Il [@
00:00 h]. Every three steps, samples were cooled down on ice for -30 seconds. Even though
samples came out of the homogenizer very warm — this is supposed to not be a problem.
The tubes were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10000 rpm at room temperature.

RNA extraction procedure takes place at room temperature.

Supernatants (500 ul approx.) were transferred to Zymo-Spin IIICG Columns placed on
collection tubes. These were then centrifuged for 30 seconds. The flow through was mixed
With one volume (500 pl) of 96-100% ethanol. Mixture was transferred to a Zymo-Spin IC
column in a fresh collection tube and centrifuged for 30 seconds at 10000 rpm. Discard flow
through.

Add 400 ul of RNA Prep Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 30 seconds at 10000 rpm.
Discard the flow through.

Add 700 ul of RNA Wash Buffer to the column. Centrifuge for 30 sec at 10000 rpm. Discard
the flow through.

Add 400 ul of RNA Wash Buffer to the column. Let it stand for a couple of minutes.
Centrifuge for 2 min, 10000 rpm. Discard the flow through.

Place the column in a DNase/RNase free 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Add 40 ui RNase-free
water directly to the membrane without touching it. Close the lid, and let it stand for 2 - 5
minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at 10000 rpm for 2 min to elute the RNA [@ 00:00
h|.

Prepare the DNase master mix: Add 0.1 volume (4 Hi} of 10X DNase |! Buffer and 1 pl of
rDNase | to the RNA, and mix gently (for 28 samples + 112 li of DNase 1 Buffer and 28 ul of
rDNase). Add 5 ul of the master mix to each sample. Incubate samples at 37°C for 30 min
[@ 00:00 until 00:00 h].

Resuspend the DNase inactivation reagent by flicking or vortexing. To stop the reaction, add
0.1 volume (4 ul} of DNase inactivation Reagent and mix well. Incubate at least for 2 min, by
flicking the tubes 2-3 times during this time [@ 00:00 h]. Centrifuge at 10000 rpm for 2 min.
Transfer 35 ul of the supernatant RNA to a fresh tube.

Quantify the amount of RNA using Nano-drop.
