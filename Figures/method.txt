Methods:

Strains and media

C. albicans isolates pairs from clade one CEC3621, CEC3678, CEC3605 and CEC3617
were stored at -80 °C in glycerol supplemented medium. Strains were maintained in YPD
(1% Yeast extract, 2% Peptone, 2% Glucose) agar plates and grown in YPD broth for
overnight cultures the day before this experiment.

Seeding C. albicans for RNA-seq

The day before experiment, pre-overnights of C. albicans strains to be used are prepared in
5 ml of YPD broth by taking up two-three colonies from a YPD agar plate. These are
incubated at 30°C in a shaking incubator for 8 h approximately. Overnights of the strains are
set up to a final concentration of an OD600 of 0.1 (1 x 10$ cells/ml) in 10 ml of YPD in
Erlenmeyer flasks. Flasks are incubated at 30°C in a shaking incubator at 200 rom.

The day of experiment, C. albicans cells were centrifuged (500 ul) and washed three times
With PBS. The yeast cells were resuspended and diluted in F12 medium to obtain a
concentration of 1.5 x 10 cells/ml. In six 96 well plates (two for each time point), relevant
wells were filled with 100 ll of fresh F12 medium. A volume of 100 ul of the C. albicans cell
dilutions was distributed to each well of the 96 well plate to obtain a concentration of 1.5 x

107 cells/well. |
Plates are incubated at 37°C and 5% CO, for the relevant times.

Times:

- Candida cultures are taken out @ 00:00 h.

- Candida cell dilutions are set up @ 00:00 h.

- _ Seeding of0h, 3h and6h time points are set up @ 00:00 h.
- Time point Oh is snap freezed immediately @ 00:00 h.

- Plate of 3his freezed @ 00:00 h.

-_ Plate of6his freezed @ 00:00 h.

After X h of infection, plates are spun down at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Keep the plate on
ice. Remove 150 ul of the supernatant, seal plate with parafilm, and snap freeze immediately
in liquid nitrogen. Plates are stored at -80°C until lysis and homogenization.

RNA extraction (7h approx. for 45 samples) — Quick RNA Fungal/Bacterial Miniprep
kit (Zymo)

Add 96 ml of 100% ethanol to the 24 mil RNA wash buffer concentrate provided by the kit.
Reconstitute the DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use, and store at -20°C.

Take the plates out of -80°C [@ 00:00 h] and add 150 ul of RNA Lysis Buffer to each well. Do
not let the plate reach room temperature. Using a tip, scrape the cells off the wells and
transfer to an Eppendorf tube containing 600 il of Lysis Buffer. Mix contents with a tip before
transferring the whole 800 ul to the ZR BashingBead Lysis tubes (0.5 mm).

Samples were homogenized six times for 2 minutes at 30 Hz using the TissueLyser Il [@
00:00 h]. Every three steps, samples were cooled down on ice for -30 seconds. Even though
samples came out of the homogenizer very warm — this is supposed to not be a problem.
The tubes were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10000 rpm at room temperature.

RNA extraction procedure takes place at room temperature.

Supernatants (500 Hi approx.) were transferred to Zymo-Spin 1IICG Columns placed on
collection tubes. These were then centrifuged for 30 seconds. The flow through was mixed
with one volume (500 pl) of 96-100% ethanol. Mixture was transferred to a Zymo-Spin IIC
column in a fresh collection tube and centrifuged for 30 seconds at 10000 rpm. Discard flow
through.
